Reference: Guangcan Liu, Time Series Forecasting via Learning Convolutionally Low-Rank Models, 2021. 

1. How to use the code:

	Just type testTSDL() to get started. To run the codes on the M4 Competition dataset,  you need to unzip the .rar files. The codes were tested on Matlab 2019a only, but the other Matlab versions should be okay.
