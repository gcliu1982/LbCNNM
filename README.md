The Matlab codes of a time series forecasting method called Learning-based Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (LbCNNM)


1. How to use the code:

	a) unzip the .rar files to get the data of M4


	b) Just type testTSDL() or testM4('Hourly') in the console to get started. The codes were tested on Matlab 2019a only, but the other Matlab versions should be okay.
